# Logo-Generator

## Description

This project is a SVG Logo generator. This project allows a user to create a SVG logo when they answer the prompted questions. 

This project allowed me to gain a better understanding of constructors. I was able to learn how they work and how to implement them.

Once you have downloaded all the files. you will need to run the command ```npm install``` to install all the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

Once you have finished the installation steps run  the command ```node index.js``` then follow the prompts that appear. 
Once all 4 questions have been answered a logo.svg will be written to the output folder.
